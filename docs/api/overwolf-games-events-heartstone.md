## `collection`

### Info Updates

key               | Category    | Values                    | Notes                 | Since Version |

#### *collection* note

* The “collection”  data is available as soon as the player logins into Hearthstone.
* The collection is getting updated when the user adds/removes a card.
  
Example for cards "collection":

```json
{ CS2_065: "{"id" : "CS2_065", "count" : "1", "premiumCount" : "0" }",
  CS1_113: "{"id" : "CS1_113", "count" : "2", "premiumCount" : "0" }",
  NEW1_011: "{"id" : "NEW1_011", "count" : "2", "premiumCount" : "0" }",

  CS2_121: "{"id" : "CS2_121", "count" : "2", "premiumCount" : "0" }",
  …
}
```

"Card" structure:

`{
  "id" : "card_id" ,
  "count" : "int" , 
  "premiumCount" : "int"
}  `

* “id” – The [card’s id](http://metastats.net/allcards/)

----------------- | ------------| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
deck_id           | decks       |  The “decks” feature provides data about the currently “visible” decks. | See [notes](#deck_id-note)    |   119.1 |
selected_deck     | selected_deck | The selected deck.  |  See [notes](#selected_deck-note)   |   119.1 |

#### *deck_id* note

Decks are “visible” when the local player starts a new game (during the “deck selection” screen) or when the local player enters the “My Collection” screen.
The following data is being provided for each deck:
* Deck name / id
* Deck cards (array of cards)

“Card” structure:

`{
  "id" : "card_id" ,
  "count" : "int" , 
  "premiumCount" : "int"
}  `
* “id” – The [card's id](http://metastats.net/allcards/)
* “count” – The amount of regular cards
* “premiumCount” – The amount of premium (golden) cards

Example for a “deck” info-update structure:

`{"feature":"decks","category":"decks","key":"Basic Shaman",
"value":"{\"deck_id\":\"Basic Shaman\",
\"cards\":[{\"id\":\"CS1_042\",\"count\":\"1\",\"premiumCount\":\"0\"},
{\"id\":\"CS2_103\",\"count\":\"1\",\"premiumCount\":\"0\"},
...
{\"id\":\"LOOT_413\",\"count\":\"2\",\"premiumCount\":\"0\"},
{\"id\":\"UNG_923\",\"count\":\"1\",\"premiumCount\":\"0\"}],
\"deck_key\":\"deck_0\"}"} `

<b>Arena Decks</b>

“Arena Deck” (unlike a standard deck), will be updated each time the local player chooses a card during the Arena Draft phase.

#### *selected_deck* note

The following data is being provided when the local player selects a deck:

* “deck_id”
* “deck_name”
* “class_skin” – Deck image name

Example for a “selected deck” structure:
