## Sample Apps

* [LOL game events sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/events-sample-apps)
* [Summoner and team info sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/lol-summoner-team-info-sample-app) – this sample app gets “summoner region” and “my team” info during the champion selection phase, before the game begins. More information about getting data from LoL launcher/client can be found [here](overwolf-games-launchers).

## `teams`

:::warning
 `teams` info-update might be provided a bit late in some game modes, as late as a few seconds before the loading screen ends. This is a known issue and we’re working on a fix.
:::

### Info Updates

key         | Category    | Values                                                                                | Notes                 | Since GEP Ver. |
----------- | ------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------- | ------------- | 
teams       | game_info   |  A URI – decoded string that represents a JSON object with the teams formation        |   Need to decodeURI() the value and then JSON.parse() the result. See example below.                    |   70.0        |

Lets assume we save the data in a variable called `info`. It will be the equivalent of:

```javascript
var info = {"info":[{"category":"game_info","key":"teams","value":
"%5B%7B%22team%22:%22Order%22,%22champion%22:%22Riven%22,%22skinId%22:%227%22,%22summoner%22:%22ruizete%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Order%22,%22champion%22:%22Twitch%22,%22skinId%22:%228%22,%22summoner%22:%22heaser%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Order%22,%22champion%22:%22Vi%22,%22skinId%22:%222%22,%22summoner%22:%22hono%20kyumin%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Order%22,%22champion%22:%22Brand%22,%22skinId%22:%225%22,%22summoner%22:%22s%C3%A2baki%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Order%22,%22champion%22:%22Kennen%22,%22skinId%22:%226%22,%22summoner%22:%22fupnlul%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Chaos%22,%22champion%22:%22Nunu%22,%22skinId%22:%226%22,%22summoner%22:%22john1126y%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Chaos%22,%22champion%22:%22Orianna%22,%22skinId%22:%220%22,%22summoner%22:%22lp%20omg%20cartman%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Chaos%22,%22champion%22:%22Ryze%22,%22skinId%22:%227%22,%22summoner%22:%22bigmoney%C5%82egolas%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Chaos%22,%22champion%22:%22Malzahar%22,%22skinId%22:%220%22,%22summoner%22:%22hell0w0rld%22%7D,
%7B%22team%22:%22Chaos%22,%22champion%22:%22Kayn%22,%22skinId%22:%220%22,%22summoner%22:%22erikolo878%22%7D%5D"}]} 
```

So now we will decode the value:

```javascript
var decoded = decodeURI(info.info[0].value);
```

And get:

```json
"[{"team":"Order","champion":"Riven","skinId":"7","summoner":"ruizete"},
{"team":"Order","champion":"Twitch","skinId":"8","summoner":"heaser"},
{"team":"Order","champion":"Vi","skinId":"2","summoner":"hono kyumin"},
{"team":"Order","champion":"Brand","skinId":"5","summoner":"sâbaki"},
{"team":"Order","champion":"Kennen","skinId":"6","summoner":"fupnlul"},
{"team":"Chaos","champion":"Nunu","skinId":"6","summoner":"john1126y"},
{"team":"Chaos","champion":"Orianna","skinId":"0","summoner":"lp omg cartman"},
{"team":"Chaos","champion":"Ryze","skinId":"7","summoner":"bigmoneyłegolas"},
{"team":"Chaos","champion":"Malzahar","skinId":"0","summoner":"hell0w0rld"},
{"team":"Chaos","champion":"Kayn","skinId":"0","summoner":"erikolo878"}]"}
```

And finally, we parse the string and get a Json array with the teams:

```javascript
var teams = JSON.parse(decoded);
```
